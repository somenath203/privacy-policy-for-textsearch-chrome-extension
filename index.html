    <h2>Collecting and Using Your Personal Data</h2>
    <h3>Types of Data Collected</h3>
    <h4>Personal Data</h4>
    <p>I do not collect any personal data from users. My extension only facilitates web searches based on text selected by the user. No personal information, such as email addresses, names, phone numbers, addresses, social media profiles, or other personal identifiers, is collected, stored, or shared.</p>
    <h4>Usage Data</h4>
    <p>I do not collect usage data. Any information such as your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g., IP address), browser type, browser version, pages visited, time and date of visit, or any other diagnostic data is not collected or stored by my extension.</p>
    <h3>Use of Your Personal Data</h3>
    <p>Since I do not collect any personal data, I do not use, store, or share any personal data.</p>
    <h3>Retention of Your Personal Data</h3>
    <p>I do not retain any personal data.</p>
    <h3>Transfer of Your Personal Data</h3>
    <p>As I do not collect any personal data, no data transfer takes place.</p>
    <h3>Delete Your Personal Data</h3>

    <h3>Disclosure of Your Personal Data</h3>
    <p>I do not collect any personal data; thus, there is no data to disclose.</p>
    <h3>Security of Your Personal Data</h3>
    <p>While I strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect any data, remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. However, since I do not collect any personal data, there is no risk to your personal data from my extension.</p>
